# PyEarthScience

The **PyEarthScience** repository created by **DKRZ** (German Climate Computing Centre) 
provides various Python modules, scripts and iPython notebooks, in particular for 
**Earth System data processing and visualization used in climate science**. 

For this, different Python modules are used, like **PyNIO, PyNGL, xarray, matplotlib, cartopy**, 
and **psyplot**.

Those who have decided to write their programs for the visualization of scientific data 
in Python, will encounter problems and questions such as - which modules are there, 
which ones are needed, which are well documented and, above all, which are still maintained 
today.

We added the **NCL Transition Examples - NCL to Python** from DKRZ to this repository too 
because most of our users are familiar with NCL but need to pivot to Python.
